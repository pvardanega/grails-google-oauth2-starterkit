### A starter kit to create applications with grails using OAuth 2.0 and Google as provider ###

In order to use it, you just have to:

1. Checkout the sources
2. Replace all occurrences of 'AppName' in the project by your application name
3. Rename oauth.properties.template from grails-app/conf to oauth.properties and copy the API and secret keys
4. Try it !
